This little project is part of TOP's curriculum and a ways to put to the test
everything i can do so far.

By the end of this i expect to solidify and internalize all of the knowledge necessary
to keep learning more about web developing.

---------This is where i'll write down how i fare with this project----------------

finished the HTML file decently well, tough there are things to be improved for sure, I used every code line i know efficiently

Made a .css file to separate the style sheet from the HTML code, I still have a lot to learn from this languaje but i managed to place everything where it's supposed to be. I plan on improve this file in the near future 

Commited all of the changes i made to these files but they aren't appearing yet, i'll check again later
